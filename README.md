# agentic_custom

Some personal cross-project code to implement minimal agentic loops, tooling, and one-shot LLM usage in a fast and familiar (to me) way. It is not meant for other people to use, but if you are crazy enough, you certainly can.

‼️ Code will go through unsolicited and unpredictable breaking changes often, so take it as it is.

Current version supports LLMs served via:
* OpenAI
* Azure
* Ollama

# Installation
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
